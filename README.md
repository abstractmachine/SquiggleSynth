# Squiggle
A simple demo Draw-A-Synth interface built for the July 2002 [InteractML Game Jam](http://interactml.com/events/iml-game-jam-july-2020.html).

# Dependencies
1. This was built using [Unity](https://unity3d.com) 2019.2.
2. This project is was built to explore the [InteractML](https://github.com/Interactml/iml-unity) library for Unity.
3. This project uses Freya Holmér's [Shapes](https://acegikmo.com/shapes/) library for Unity.

# Influences
This demo references « [Scribble](http://www.flong.com/projects/scribble/) », a draw-a-synth performance system created by Golan Levin circa 2000.

An additional influence for the term « Squiggle » comes from D.W. Winnicott. Cf. [The Squiggle-Drawing Game in Child Psychotherapy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7416320/)

This mini-project is a spin-off of some drawing-based A.I. research and tool-building I have been exploring over the past few months with mobile Raspberry PI systems using [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc), and the core machine methods tools native to [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) (cv. [Machine Learning Overview](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/dd6/ml_intro.html)). Some early forms of these experiments were developed during confinement with [Pang Pang Club](https://pangpangclub.itch.io) (cf. notes from the [Chez Moi Game Jam](https://itch.io/c/825397/chez-moi-au-club)).
